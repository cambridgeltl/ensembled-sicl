"The world changed on September 11, 2001, and since that day, under the strong, steady, and visionary leadership of President George W. Bush, Americans have helped make the world not only safer, but better."	305	"3"
"The President continues to lead a steady, confident, systematic campaign to defend America against the dangers of our time."	605	"6"
"We are going after terrorists wherever they plot and plan and hide, changing the old course of pinprick strikes that did little to get at the root of terrorism."	605	"6"
"We eliminated many of al Qaeda's key leaders and put the world on notice that nations that train, harbor, or finance terrorists are just as guilty as the terrorists themselves."	605	"6"
"We will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to possess the world's most dangerous weapons."	605	"6"
"Our message is getting through, as indicated by Libya's leader, who decided to turn over his weapons of mass destruction and cooperate with the international community."	605	"6"
"Today, because America has acted, and because America has led, the forces of terror and tyranny have suffered defeat after defeat, and America and the world are safer."	605	"6"
"On September 11, 2001, we saw the cruelty of the terrorists, and we glimpsed the future they intend for us."	605	"6"
"They intend to strike the United States to the limits of their power."	605	"6"
"They seek weapons of mass destruction to kill Americans on an even greater scale."	605	"6"
"This danger is increased when outlaw regimes build or acquire weapons of mass destruction and maintain ties to terrorist groups."	605	"6"
"On September 11, 2001, we saw the spirit of courage and optimism of the American people - that greatest assurance of the ultimate triumph of our cause."	605	"6"

"We will fight them with everything we have - and we will prevail."	605	"6"
"President Bush answered the challenge of September 11, 2001, not only with steadfast resolve, but also with vision, optimism, and unshakable confidence in the will and faith of the American people."	305	"3"
"That is what we all saw on September 14, 2001, when our President stood with the brave workers at Ground Zero and resolutely assured our nation amidst our shock, anger, and grief that while the terrorists had struck first, America would have the last word."	305	"3"
"The President's most solemn duty is to protect our country."	305	"3"
"George W. Bush has kept that charge."	305	"3"
"To protect our people, President Bush is leading America, staying on the offensive against threats within our own country."	305	"3"
"He worked with Congress to establish the Department of Homeland Security in the most significant reorganization of the federal government since 1947."	305	"3"
"The PATRIOT Act is being used to track terrorist activity and to break up terror cells."	605	"6"
"Now, the FBI can use tools that have been long available to fight organized crime and drug trafficking, but could not be used in the past to fight terrorism."	605	"6"
"Intelligence and law enforcement officials are sharing information as never before."	605	"6"
"The President transformed the mission of the FBI to focus first and foremost on preventing terrorism."	605	"6"
"Every element of America's homeland security plan is critical, because the terrorists are ruthless and resourceful - and we know they are preparing to attack us again."	605	"6"
"It is not possible to guarantee perfect security in our vast, free nation."	605	"6"
"But the President and Vice President, along with many fine professionals in intelligence, homeland security, law enforcement, and the military are working tirelessly to protect the country."	605	"6"
"We are grateful to them all."	605	"6"
"President Bush recognized that to overcome the dangers of our time, America would have to take a new approach in the world."	305	"3"
"That approach is marked by a determination to challenge new threats, not ignore them, or simply wait for future tragedy - and by a renewed commitment to building a hopeful future in hopeless places, instead of allowing troubled regions to remain in despair and explode in violence."	305	"3"
"Before entering office, President Bush recognized that our age is a time of opportunity for America - opportunity to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty."	107	"1"
"That conviction is in the finest traditions of the Republican Party."	107	"1"
"As our platform said in 1984, during the height of Cold War confrontation: \"The supreme purpose of our foreign policy must be to maintain our freedom in a peaceful international environment in which the United States and our allies and friends are secure against military threats, and democratic governments are flourishing in a world of increasing prosperity.”"	107	"1"
"The reality of 9/11 does not diminish our generation's opportunity to advance the cause of freedom but in fact makes it all the more important that we take up that challenge."	107	"1"
"President Bush has rallied America to its calling - to make the world safer and better."	107	"1"
"This calling is answered by a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests."	107	"1"
"Americans everywhere are remaining faithful to that duty."	107	"1"
"By keeping our word and holding firm to our values, this generation is showing the world the power of liberty once again."	107	"1"
"Republicans support President Bush's steadfast commitment to the goal of a lasting, democratic peace, in which all nations are free from the threat of sudden terror."	202	"2"
"We affirm the three commitments of the President's strategy for peace:"	106	"1"
"• Terrorists long ago declared war on America, and now America has declared war against terrorists."	104	"1"
"We are defending the peace by taking the fight to the enemy."	104	"1"
"We are confronting terrorists overseas so we do not have to confront them here at home."	104	"1"
"We are destroying the leadership of terrorist networks in sudden raids, disrupting their planning and financing, and keeping them on the run."	104	"1"
"Month by month, we are shrinking the space in which they can freely operate, by denying them territory and the support of governments."	104	"1"
"•Nations that support terrorism are just as dangerous, and just as guilty, as the perpetrators of terrorism."	101	"1"
"Every nation must make a choice to support terror or to support America and our coalition to defeat terror."	101	"1"
"We are preserving the peace by working with more than 80 allied nations, as well as international institutions, to isolate and confront terrorists and outlaw regimes."	101	"1"
"America is leading a broad coalition of nations to disrupt proliferation."	107	"1"
"We are working with the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international organizations to take action in our common security."	107	"1"
"The global threat of terrorism requires a global response."	104	"1"
"To be effective, that global response requires leadership - and America is leading."	104	"1"
"•There is no negotiation with terrorists."	202	"2"
"No form of therapy or coercion will turn them from their murderous ways."	202	"2"
"Only total and complete destruction of terrorism will allow freedom to flourish."	202	"2"
"We will extend the peace by supporting the rise of democracy, and the hope and progress that democracy brings, as the alternative to hatred and terror in the broader Middle East."	202	"2"
"In democratic societies, men and women do not swear allegiance to malcontents and murderers; they turn their hearts and labor to building better lives."	202	"2"
"Democratic governments do not shelter terrorist camps or attack their neighbors."	202	"2"
"When justice and democracy advance, so does the hope of lasting peace."	202	"2"
"We are proud of the President's steady leadership in executing this strategy."	305	"3"
"We are dealing with terrorist threats as they gather, rather than waiting for them to become imminent dangers."	305	"3"
"The results are clear to see."	305	"3"
"•Three years ago, our nation was not on a war footing against al Qaeda - even though Osama bin Laden declared war on the United States in 1996 and again in 1998."	605	"6"
"The al Qaeda leadership believed itself to be impervious to any American response, continued to raise funds practically without restriction, and operated in a world in which there was no cohesive global approach to fighting terror."	605	"6"
"Today, al Qaeda has been wounded, having lost many of its known leaders and most of its important sanctuaries."	605	"6"
"America and its allies and friends have broken al Qaeda cells here in the United States and overseas."	605	"6"
"A global coalition, led by the United States, has dried up sources of terrorist financing."	101	"1"
"Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel remain on the manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves."	104	"1"
"Today, because of the solidarity of the international coalition in the War on Terror, we are bringing these terrorists to justice, and the American people are safer."	101	"1"
"•Three years ago, al Qaeda's secure home base was in Afghanistan, a country ruled by the Taliban, one of the most backward and brutal regimes of modern history."	605	"6"
"Schooling was denied to girls."	605	"6"
"Women were whipped and executed in public."	605	"6"
"Millions lived in fear."	605	"6"
"With protection from the Taliban, al Qaeda and its associates trained, indoctrinated, and sent forth thousands of killers to set up terror cells in dozens of countries, including our own."	605	"6"
"Today, Afghanistan is a world away from the nightmare of the Taliban."	201	"2"
"Twentyeight million people are free."	201	"2"
"That country has a good and just president."	201	"2"
"Boys and girls are being educated."	201	"2"
"Women are respected."	201	"2"
"Many refugees have returned home to rebuild their country, and a presidential election is scheduled for this fall."	201	"2"
"The terror camps are closed and the Afghan government is helping us to hunt the Taliban and terrorists in remote regions."	605	"6"
"Today, because we acted to liberate Afghanistan, a threat has been removed, and the American people are safer."	605	"6"
"•Three years ago, Pakistan was one of the few countries in the world that recognized the Taliban regime."	102	"1"
"Al Qaeda was active and recruiting in Pakistan."	102	"1"
"Pakistan served as a transit point for al Qaeda terrorists leaving Afghanistan on missions of murder."	102	"1"
"The United States could not count on the support of Pakistan's military and civilian leaders - the very people we would need to help shut down al Qaeda operations in that part of the world."	102	"1"
"Today, the governments of the United States and Pakistan are working closely in the fight against terror."	101	"1"
"Pakistan has helped capture Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the operational planner behind the September 11 attacks, and other terrorists."	101	"1"
"Pakistani forces are rounding up terrorists along their nation's western border."	101	"1"
"Today, because we are working with Pakistani leaders, Pakistan is an ally in the War on Terror, and the American people are safer."	101	"1"
"•Three years ago, terrorists were well-established in Saudi Arabia."	102	"1"
"Inside that country, fundraisers and other facilitators gave al Qaeda financial and logistical help with little scrutiny or opposition."	102	"1"
"Today, after the attacks in Riyadh and elsewhere, the Saudi government knows that al Qaeda is its enemy."	101	"1"
"Saudi Arabia is working hard to shut down the facilitators and financial supporters of terrorism."	101	"1"
"The government has captured or killed many first-tier leaders of the al Qaeda organization in Saudi Arabia."	101	"1"
"Today, because Saudi Arabia has seen the danger and has joined the War on Terror, the American people are safer."	101	"1"
"•Three years ago, the ruler of Iraq was a sworn enemy of America who provided safe haven for terrorists, used weapons of mass destruction, and turned his nation into a prison."	102	"1"
"Saddam Hussein was not just a dictator; he was a proven mass murderer who refused to account for weapons of mass murder."	102	"1"
"He defied the international community and seventeen United Nations resolutions over the course of twelve years, giving no indication that Iraq would ever disarm and comply with the just demands of the world."	102	"1"
"In 2002 - in Resolution 1441 - the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted that Saddam Hussein had one final chance to comply with his obligations to the international community, or there would be serious consequences."	102	"1"
"As he had for over a decade, he refused to comply."	102	"1"
"Every responsible nation recognized this threat, and knew it could not go on forever."	102	"1"
"Today, the dictator who caused decades of death and turmoil, who twice invaded his neighbors, who harbored terrorist leaders, who used chemical weapons on innocent men, women, and children, finally stands before the bar of justice."	605	"6"
"Iraq, which once had the worst government in the Middle East, is now becoming an example of reform to the region."	605	"6"
"Iraqi security forces are fighting beside coalition troops to defeat the terrorists and foreign fighters who threaten their nation and the world."	605	"6"
"Today, because America and our coalition helped to end the violent regime of Saddam Hussein, and because we are helping to raise a peaceful democracy in its place, 25 million Iraqis are free and the American people are safer."	605	"6"
"•Three years ago, the nation of Libya, a longtime supporter of terror, was spending millions to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons."	102	"1"
"Today, thousands of Libya's chemical munitions have been destroyed."	101	"1"
"Libya's nuclear equipment that could ultimately have threatened the lives of hundreds of thousands is stored away in the United States."	101	"1"
"Today, because the Libyan government saw the seriousness of the civilized world, and correctly judged its own interests, the American people are safer."	101	"1"
"•Three years ago, a private weapons proliferation network was doing business around the world."	605	"6"
"This network, operated by the Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, was selling nuclear plans and equipment to the highest bidder, and found willing buyers in places like Libya, Iran, and North Korea."	605	"6"
"Today, the A.Q. Khan network is out of business."	605	"6"
"We have ended one of the most dangerous sources of proliferation in the world, and the American people are safer."	605	"6"
"Republicans applaud President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and those who have supported them in the Congress for the steady leadership that led to these successes."	605	"6"
"America must stay the course."	605	"6"
"Consolidating Gains in the War on Terror"	NA	NA

"Republicans believe that America and the world must keep our commitments to the people of those countries, who are building the world's newest democracies and counting on the world to help."	202	"2"
"Delivering these nations from tyranny has required sacrifice and loss."	202	"2"
"We must honor that sacrifice by finishing the great work we have begun."	202	"2"
"Republicans appreciate the military, financial, and technical assistance provided by the dozens of nations contributing to the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq."	101	"1"
"The success of free and stable governments in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere will further shrink the space in which terrorists can operate."	605	"6"
"As the entire region sees the promise of freedom in its midst, the terrorist ideology will become more and more irrelevant, until that day when it is viewed with contempt or ignored altogether."	605	"6"
"The forces of many nations are working with Afghans to find and defeat Taliban remnants and eliminate al Qaeda terrorists."	104	"1"
"We applaud the work of American forces and coalition partners in helping to build the new Afghan national army and to train new Afghan police and border patrol."	104	"1"
"Together, Afghan and international forces will maintain the peace, secure Afghanistan's borders, and deny terrorists any foothold in that country."	104	"1"
"We applaud President Bush's announcement of U.S. support for five new initiatives that will help the Afghan people achieve the peace, stability, and prosperity they deserve - through support for the development of democracy, educational assistance, cultural exchanges, enhanced bilateral economic ties, and increased economic opportunity for women."	201	"2"

"The world and the United States look forward to elections this year in Afghanistan and stand with the Afghan people as partners in their quest for peace and prosperity, stability, and democracy."	202	"2"
"As Republicans, we do not equivocate, as others have done, about whether America should have gone to war in Iraq."	104	"1"
"The best intelligence available at the time indicated that Saddam Hussein was a threat."	104	"1"
"On that point, President Bush, members of both parties in Congress, and the United Nations agreed."	104	"1"
"While the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction we expected to find in Iraq have not yet materialized, we have confirmed that Saddam Hussein had the capability to reconstitute his weapons programs and the desire to do so."	104	"1"
"Our nation did the right thing, and the American people are now safer because we and our allies ended the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, halting his decades-long pursuit of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons."	104	"1"
"President Bush had a choice to make: Trust a madman or defend America."	104	"1"
"He chose defending America."	104	"1"
"Supported by brave coalition allies such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, and Denmark,"	101	"1"
"and displaying courage, skill, and resourcefulness on the battlefield, the men and women of our Armed Forces removed the dictator of Iraq, a declared enemy of America who had the capability and intent to produce weapons of mass murder, and could have passed that capability to terrorists bent on killing Americans."	104	"1"
"That was a risk we could not take."	104	"1"

"We also salute our coalition allies."	101	"1"
"Their efforts with us to shape a world where freedom is honored and liberty is cherished deserves respect and admiration; their sacrifice, too, does not go without notice and appreciation."	101	"1"
"We are ever mindful that American troops remain on the ground in Iraq, working steadfastly to help the Iraqi people achieve stability and democracy."	104	"1"
"We therefore welcome declarations from responsible political leaders of both parties that our nation will persevere in our mission there, not cut and run."	104	"1"
"The American people need to hear this message."	104	"1"
"People in Baghdad and beyond need to hear it."	104	"1"
"The enemy needs to hear it."	104	"1"
"Most importantly, American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines risking their lives in Iraq need to hear it."	104	"1"
"We condemn inconsistent, ambiguous, and politically expedient statements on that point."	305	"3"
"To the extent such wavering encourages our adversaries to fight harder, our men and women in uniform suffer the consequences."	305	"3"

"The United States and our coalition partners are helping prepare Iraqis for the defense of their own country, including through the work of the NATO mission to train Iraqi security forces."	101	"1"

"However, it is equally obvious that much more remains to be done to reform the federal tax code."	402	"4"
"Instead of being simple, the current tax system is needlessly complex, making it susceptible to abusive tax avoidance schemes."	404	"4"
"Instead of being efficient, it punishes hard work, discourages savings and investment, and hinders the international competitiveness of U.S. firms."	404	"4"
"Instead of being fair, it is out of line with our basic values and undermines our sense of fairness."	404	"4"
"Instead of being predictable, it is highly unpredictable and uncertain."	404	"4"

"In particular, we must:"	NA	NA
"•Make the tax relief of 2001 and 2003 permanent."	402	"4"

"Its stated goal is to insure that high-income taxpayers pay some amount of income tax."	303	"3"
"But due to the lack of indexing, the broad base and reach of the current AMT will make it apply increasingly to middle-income taxpayers."	303	"3"

"The challenges America has faced over the last four years have created an unwelcome but manageable budget deficit."	404	"4"
"These deficits are due to a number of factors: the stock market downturn that began in 2000 and the subsequent recession that President Bush inherited when he took office; the terrorist attacks on America and the necessary spending for homeland security and the War on Terror those attacks precipitated; and the crisis in confidence produced by corporate scandals that were years in the making."	404	"4"
"It is important to view the size of the deficit in relation to the size of the nation's economy."	404	"4"
"By that measure, today's deficit, although unwelcome, is well within historical ranges."	404	"4"
"A deficit that is 3. 8 percent of GDP, as is now projected for this year, would be smaller than the deficits in nine of the last 25 years, and far below the peak deficit figure of 6 percent of GDP reached in 1983."	404	"4"
"This deficit is also in line with what other industrialized nations are facing today."	404	"4"
"The U. S. deficit matches the average deficit within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and is below the levels of France, Germany, and Japan."	404	"4"
"Much more importantly, because the President and Congress enacted pro-growth economic policies, the deficit is headed strongly in the right direction."	404	"4"
"Next year's projected deficit, at 2. 7 percent of GDP, would be smaller than those in 14 of the last 25 years."	404	"4"
"As Republicans in Congress work with the President to restrain spending and strengthen economic growth, the federal deficit will fall to 1. 5 percent of the nation's economic output in 2009 - well below the 2. 2 percent average of the last 40 years."	404	"4"
"The events that brought us into deficit are not completely behind us."	404	"4"

"Tax cuts allow American workers, families, business owners, and investors to keep more of their own money."	404	"4"
"New spending requires the government to take control of a bigger slice of the economy."	404	"4"
"We recognize that the problem is not that the American people are taxed too little but that the federal government spends too much."	404	"4"
"To ensure that the federal government respects the burdens on taxpayers and spends only as much as is necessary to accomplish our common goals, we support extending the pay-as-you-go requirement for mandatory spending only."	404	"4"
"Limiting Spending Growth"	NA	NA
"Spending limits will help Congress restrain the growth of government."	404	"4"
"We support a cap on discretionary spending that will limit the growth of overall spending while ensuring that priorities such as our nation's security will continue to be met."	404	"4"
"We applaud President Bush for submitting a budget for 2005 that provides significant increases in funding to win the War on Terror and protect the homeland, while limiting the growth in all other non-security related discretionary spending to less than one percent."	404	"4"
"Line-Item Veto"	NA	NA
"To further the goal of respecting taxpayers' dollars and restraining spending, we endorse the creation of a line-item veto, which the President could use consistent with the Constitution to reject new appropriations, new mandatory spending, or limited grants of tax benefits (to 100 or fewer beneficiaries) whenever he determines the spending or tax benefits are not essential priorities."	404	"4"
"Under this approach, all savings from the line-item veto would be used for deficit reduction, and could not be applied to other spending."	404	"4"
"Governors across the nation already have and use this tool to reduce unnecessary spending."	404	"4"
"The President should have the same option."	404	"4"
"Sunset Commission"	NA	NA

"We endorse creating a commission to evaluate discretionary spending on federal agencies and programs to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used for the best, most efficient purposes."	303	"3"
"Such a commission would determine whether certain programs are duplicative, wasteful or inefficient, outdated or irrelevant, or failed."	303	"3"
"It would recommend to Congress programs that could be terminated, moved, or restructured to make the government more efficient."	303	"3"
"Management Agenda"	NA	NA
"New government programs are frequently created with little review of programs that already exist to address the same perceived problem."	303	"3"
"Over time, numerous programs with overlapping missions and competing agendas grow up alongside one another - wasting money and baffling citizens."	303	"3"
"We support President Bush's vision for government reform, which is guided by three principles."	303	"3"
"Government should be: citizen-centered, not bureaucracy-centered; results-oriented; and market-based, actively promoting rather than stifling innovation through competition."	303	"3"
"The President's management agenda is an effective tool for making sure government is active but limited, focusing on results and obtaining them efficiently."	303	"3"

"When corporate leaders break the law, they should be punished."	305	"3"
"After fraudulent corporate practices rooted in the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s began to surface in the closing months of 2001, President Bush worked with the Congress to take decisive action to restore honesty and integrity to America's corporate boardrooms."	605	"6"
"In July 2002, President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the most farreaching reform of American business practices since the 1940s."	605	"6"
"Under this new law, CEOs and Chief Financial Officers are required to personally vouch for the truth and fairness of their companies' disclosures; for the first time, an independent board has been established to oversee the accounting profession; investigators have been given new tools to root out corporate fraud; and enhanced penalties are ensuring that dishonest corporate officials do hard time."	605	"6"
"We applaud President Bush for vigorously enforcing the law to deter and punish further corporate abuses."	603	"6"
"He established an interagency Corporate Fraud Task Force to investigate and prosecute financial crimes; to recover the proceeds of those crimes; and to hold corporate criminals to account."	603	"6"

"More than $1 billion in forfeited funds has also been recovered from corporate wrongdoers for return to defrauded creditors and investors."	605	"6"

"The way to alleviate that burden is to bring down the cost of health care in America."	402	"4"
"Shifting the cost-burden onto the federal or state governments - costs that will ultimately be borne by the taxpayers - is not an effective solution to the problem."	402	"4"
"We must attack the root causes of high health care costs by: aiding small businesses in offering health care to their employees; empowering the self-employed through access to affordable coverage; putting patients and doctors in charge of medical decisions; reducing junk lawsuits and limiting punitive damage awards that raise the cost of health care; and seizing the cost-saving and quality-enhancing potential of emerging health technologies."	402	"4"

"In many cases, costs are so prohibitive that many obstetrics/gynecology practices are scaling back service or choosing not to practice altogether."	411	"4"
"Junk lawsuits add at least $60 billion to health care costs in America because doctors are forced to practice defensive medicine, ordering extensive, unnecessary, and expensive tests and procedures to keep trial lawyers at bay."	411	"4"
"The President has proposed, and the Republican House of Representatives has passed, reforms that would speed compensation to injured patients, reduce health care costs, and improve Americans' access to quality health care."	305	"3"

"The Administration is working with private sector innovators to develop reliable, secure methods of storing personal medical information that will broaden the benefits of health IT."	411	"4"
"Privacy is paramount, and participation by patients will be voluntary."	411	"4"
"These electronic health records will be designed to share information among and between health care providers only when authorized by a patient."	411	"4"

"By sharing information, health professionals can determine ways to avoid errors and complications."	411	"4"
"These efforts are blocked, however, because good-faith efforts to improve quality and safety are targets for lawsuits based on new information that is made public in the review process."	411	"4"

"This new program would allow workers who currently hold jobs to come out of the shadows and to participate legally in America's economy."	605	"6"
"It would allow men and women who enter the program to apply for citizenship in the same manner as those who apply from outside the United States."	605	"6"
"There must be strong workplace enforcement with tough penalties against employees and employers who violate immigration laws."	605	"6"
"We oppose amnesty because it would have the effect of encouraging illegal immigration and would give an unfair advantage to those who have broken our laws."	603	"6"
"To better ensure that immigrants enter the United States only through legal means that allow for verification of their identity, reconnaissance cameras, border patrol agents, and unmanned aerial flights have all been increased at the border."	605	"6"
"In addition, Border Patrol agents now have sweeping new powers to deport illegal aliens without having first to go through the cumbersome process of allowing the illegal alien to have a hearing before an immigration judge."	605	"6"

"In 1996, the Republican Congress made history by passing welfare reform that revolutionized the way the government helps people build better lives for themselves."	505	"5"
"The federal government gave states the flexibility to manage the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and both states and federal authorities began treating welfare as a step up rather than a way of life."	505	"5"
"Since the 1996 Republican-led law, welfare caseloads have declined by half, and nearly three million Americans have been lifted out of poverty."	505	"5"

"We need to build on the results of the 1996 reforms and continue to move welfare recipients into jobs and off the welfare rolls."	505	"5"

"The Republican Party shares the position of the United States Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), that obscene material is \"unprotected by the first amendment\" (413 U.S. at 23) and that \"to equate the free and robust exchange of ideas and political debate with commercial exploitation of obscene material demeans the grand conception of the first amendment and its high purposes in the historic struggle for freedom” Miller, 413 U.S. at 34."	605	"6"

"We believe, and the social science confirms, that the well-being of children is best accomplished in the environment of the home, nurtured by their mother and father anchored by the bonds of marriage."	603	"6"
"We further believe that legal recognition and the accompanying benefits afforded couples should be preserved for that unique and special union of one man and one woman which has historically been called marriage."	603	"6"

"Attempts to redefine marriage in a single state or city could have serious consequences throughout the country, and anything less than a Constitutional amendment, passed by the Congress and ratified by the states, is vulnerable to being overturned by activist judges."	603	"6"

"The Constitutional amendment process guarantees that the final decision will rest with the American people and their elected representatives."	603	"6"
