"Spend only what is necessary, and tax only to raise revenue for essential government functions."	402	"4"
"Unleash the power of enterprise, innovation, civic energy, and the American spirit — and never pretend that government is a substitute for family or community."	402	"4"
"The other party wants more government control over people's lives and earnings; Republicans do not."	305	"3"
"The other party wants to continue pork barrel politics; we are disgusted by it, no matter who practices it."	305	"3"

"The entrenched culture of official Washington — an intrusive tax-and-spend liberalism — remains a formidable foe, but we will confront and ultimately defeat it."	408	"4"
"Washington’s Failure: the Scope of the Problem"	NA	NA
"The federal government collects $2.7 trillion a year from American families and businesses."	305	"3"
"That's $7.4 billion a day."	305	"3"
"Even worse, it spends over $3 trillion a year: $8.2 billion a day."	305	"3"
"Why? Largely because those who created this bloated government will not admit a single mistake or abolish a single program."	305	"3"
"Here are some staggering examples of the overall problem: * Recent audits show that 22% of all federal programs are ineffective or incapable of demonstrating results. * 69 separate programs, administered by 10 different agencies, provide education or care to children under the age of 5. * Nine separate agencies administer 44 different programs for job training.   • 23 separate programs, each with its own overhead, provide housing assistance to the elderly."	305	"3"
"With so many redundant, inefficient, and ineffective federal programs, it is no wonder that the American people have so little confidence in Washington to act effectively when federal action is really needed."	305	"3"
"The Budget Process — A Fraud that Guarantees Runaway Spending"	NA	NA
"For more than three decades — since enactment of the Budget Act of 1974 by a Democrat-controlled Congress — the federal government has operated within a rigged system notable for its lack of transparency."	305	"3"
"The earlier approach — annual passage of the appropriation bills, amended and voted up or down, with the numbers there for all to see — had its flaws and generated much red ink."	305	"3"
"But its replacement, the current budget process, only worsened the money flow and came to rely on monstrous omnibus spending bills."	305	"3"
"The results are adverse to all seeking to limit government's growth."	305	"3"
"For example: * The budget process assumes every spending project will be on the books forever, even if the law says the spending will expire — but it assumes tax relief will be temporary. * It treats well-deserved tax cuts as a kind of spending, so that letting Americans keep more of their earnings is considered the same as more spending on pork projects. * It fails to recognize the positive impact that lowering tax rates has on economic growth. * In its deceptive and irresponsible accounting, an increase in a program's funding is actually a decrease if it is less than the rate of inflation. * Once a budget is produced under that sys tem, the budget law itself limits the time Congress can consider it before voting."	305	"3"
"Moreover, the budget's review process is a sham."	305	"3"
"Of the $3 trillion spent annually, only one-third is reviewed each year during the budget and appropriations process. The remaining $2 trillion automatically goes to interest on the national debt or entitlements."	305	"3"
"And because the budget process assumes an automatic increase in spending, the debate on the remaining one-third is only over how much more spending to approve."	305	"3"
"Finally, while government requires corporations to budget for future pension and health care costs, our government ignores those requirements."	305	"3"
"No family or private sector business could keep its books the way Washington keeps ours."	305	"3"
"A Plan to Control Spending"	NA	NA

"Earmarking must stop."	408	"4"
"To eliminate wasteful projects and pay-offs to special interests, we will impose an immediate moratorium on the earmarking system and reform the appropriations process through full transparency."	408	"4"
"Tax dollars must be distributed on the basis of clear national priorities, not a politician's seniority or party position."	408	"4"
"* Government waste must be taken off autopilot."	408	"4"
"We call for a one-year pause in nondefense, non-veterans discretionary spend   ing to force a critical, cost-benefit review of all current programs."	408	"4"
"* We call for a constitutionally sound presidential line-item veto."	203	"2"
"* If billions are worth spending, they should be spent in the light of day."	408	"4"
"We will insist that, before either the House or Senate considers a spending bill, every item in it should be presented in advance to the taxpayers on the Internet."	408	"4"
"* Because the problem is too much spending, not too few taxes, we support a supermajority requirement in both the House and Senate to guard against tax hikes."	408	"4"
"* New authorizations should be offset by reducing another program, and no appropriation should be permitted without a current authorization."	414	"4"
"* Congressional ethics rules governing special interests should apply across the board, without the special exemptions now granted to favored institutions."	408	"4"
"* We support the Government Shutdown Protection Act to ensure the continuance of essential federal functions when advocates of pork threaten to shut down the government unless their wasteful spending is accepted."	414	"4"
"* We will insist that the budget reasonably plan for the long-term costs of pension and health care programs and urge the conversion of such programs to defined contribution programs."	404	"4"
"Empowering the States, Improving Public Services"	NA	NA
"The long term solution for many of Washington's problems is structural."	203	"2"
"Congress must respect the limits imposed upon it by the Tenth Amendment: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\""	203	"2"
"We look to the model of Republican welfare reform, which, since its enactment in 1996, has accomplished a major transfer of resources and responsibility from the federal government back to the states — with an accompanying improvement in the program itself."	301	"3"
"Applying that approach to other programs will steer Congress back into line with the Constitution, reversing both its intrusion into state matters and its neglect of its central duties."	203	"2"
"To aid in the fulfillment of those duties, we propose a National Sunset Commission to review all federal programs and recommend which of them should be terminated due to redundancy, waste, or intrusion into the American family."	303	"3"
"The Congress would then be required by law to schedule one yea or nay vote on the entire sunset list with no amendments."	303	"3"
"Additionally, as important as returning power to the states is returning power to the people."	301	"3"
"As the Declaration of Independence states, our rights are endowed to us by our Creator and are inalienable: rights to life, liberty, and property."	601	"6"

"The Republican Party strongly affirms these rights and demands that government respect them."	601	"6"
"Congress Must Improve Oversight of Government Programs"	NA	NA
"Congress has a fundamental duty to conduct meaningful oversight on the effectiveness of government programs, not use every hearing as an opportunity for political grandstanding."	303	"3"
"To that end:  • We urge every congressional committee to reserve at least one week every month to conduct oversight of the nearly 1,700 separate grant and loan programs of the federal government."	303	"3"
"* To prevent conflicts of interest, a Truth in Testimony mandate should require all committee witnesses to detail the amount of federal funding they and their employer currently receive and, in the case of associations, how much federal money their members would receive from the proposed legislation."	303	"3"
"* Because official Washington does not even know how much land it owns, we call for a national audit of all federally-owned properties as a first step toward returning unnecessary properties to the American people or to state and local government for public use."	303	"3"
"Improving the Work of Government"	NA	NA
"Modern management of the federal government is long overdue."	303	"3"
"The expected retirement over the next ten years of more than 40 percent of the federal workforce, and 60 percent of its managers, presents a rare opportunity: a chance to gradually shrink the size of government while using technology to increase its effectiveness and reshape the way agencies do business."	411	"4"
"Each agency must be able to pass a financial audit and set annual targets for improving efficiency with fewer resources."	303	"3"
"Civil service managers should be given incentives for more effective leadership, including protection against the current guilty-until-proven-innocent grievance procedures which disgruntled employees use against them to thwart reform."	303	"3"

"We will provide Internet transparency in all federal contracting as a necessary step in combating cost overruns."	411	"4"

"We recognize the need for a natural disaster insurance policy."	504	"5"

"We must make it easier for both businesses and non-profits to act as force-multipliers in relief situations."	504	"5"

"That can leave entire communities vulnerable to natural disasters and deprive others of the improvements necessary for economic growth and  job creation."	408	"4"
"We pledge a business-like, cost-effective approach for infrastructure spending, always mindful of the special needs of both rural and urban communities."	411	"4"

"Unleash the power of enterprise, innovation, civic energy, and the American spirit — and never pretend that government is a substitute for family or community."	402	"4"
"The other party wants more government control over people's lives and earnings; Republicans do not."	305	"3"

"The entrenched culture of official Washington — an intrusive tax-and-spend liberalism — remains a formidable foe, but we will confront and ultimately defeat it."	408	"4"
"Washington’s Failure: the Scope of the Problem"	NA	NA
"The federal government collects $2.7 trillion a year from American families and businesses."	305	"3"
"That's $7.4 billion a day."	305	"3"
"Even worse, it spends over $3 trillion a year: $8.2 billion a day."	305	"3"
"Why? Largely because those who created this bloated government will not admit a single mistake or abolish a single program."	305	"3"
"Here are some staggering examples of the overall problem: * Recent audits show that 22% of all federal programs are ineffective or incapable of demonstrating results. * 69 separate programs, administered by 10 different agencies, provide education or care to children under the age of 5. * Nine separate agencies administer 44 different programs for job training.   • 23 separate programs, each with its own overhead, provide housing assistance to the elderly."	305	"3"
"With so many redundant, inefficient, and ineffective federal programs, it is no wonder that the American people have so little confidence in Washington to act effectively when federal action is really needed."	305	"3"
"The Budget Process — A Fraud that Guarantees Runaway Spending"	NA	NA
"For more than three decades — since enactment of the Budget Act of 1974 by a Democrat-controlled Congress — the federal government has operated within a rigged system notable for its lack of transparency."	305	"3"
"The earlier approach — annual passage of the appropriation bills, amended and voted up or down, with the numbers there for all to see — had its flaws and generated much red ink."	305	"3"
"But its replacement, the current budget process, only worsened the money flow and came to rely on monstrous omnibus spending bills."	305	"3"
"The results are adverse to all seeking to limit government's growth."	305	"3"
"For example: * The budget process assumes every spending project will be on the books forever, even if the law says the spending will expire — but it assumes tax relief will be temporary. * It treats well-deserved tax cuts as a kind of spending, so that letting Americans keep more of their earnings is considered the same as more spending on pork projects. * It fails to recognize the positive impact that lowering tax rates has on economic growth. * In its deceptive and irresponsible accounting, an increase in a program's funding is actually a decrease if it is less than the rate of inflation. * Once a budget is produced under that sys tem, the budget law itself limits the time Congress can consider it before voting."	305	"3"
"Moreover, the budget's review process is a sham."	305	"3"
"Of the $3 trillion spent annually, only one-third is reviewed each year during the budget and appropriations process. The remaining $2 trillion automatically goes to interest on the national debt or entitlements."	305	"3"
"And because the budget process assumes an automatic increase in spending, the debate on the remaining one-third is only over how much more spending to approve."	305	"3"
"Finally, while government requires corporations to budget for future pension and health care costs, our government ignores those requirements."	305	"3"
"No family or private sector business could keep its books the way Washington keeps ours."	305	"3"

"To eliminate wasteful projects and pay-offs to special interests, we will impose an immediate moratorium on the earmarking system and reform the appropriations process through full transparency."	408	"4"
"Tax dollars must be distributed on the basis of clear national priorities, not a politician's seniority or party position."	408	"4"
"* Government waste must be taken off autopilot."	408	"4"
"We call for a one-year pause in nondefense, non-veterans discretionary spend   ing to force a critical, cost-benefit review of all current programs."	408	"4"
"* We call for a constitutionally sound presidential line-item veto."	203	"2"
"* If billions are worth spending, they should be spent in the light of day."	408	"4"
"We will insist that, before either the House or Senate considers a spending bill, every item in it should be presented in advance to the taxpayers on the Internet."	408	"4"
"* Because the problem is too much spending, not too few taxes, we support a supermajority requirement in both the House and Senate to guard against tax hikes."	408	"4"
"* New authorizations should be offset by reducing another program, and no appropriation should be permitted without a current authorization."	414	"4"
"* Congressional ethics rules governing special interests should apply across the board, without the special exemptions now granted to favored institutions."	408	"4"
"* We support the Government Shutdown Protection Act to ensure the continuance of essential federal functions when advocates of pork threaten to shut down the government unless their wasteful spending is accepted."	414	"4"

"Empowering the States, Improving Public Services"	NA	NA

"Congress must respect the limits imposed upon it by the Tenth Amendment: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\""	203	"2"
"We look to the model of Republican welfare reform, which, since its enactment in 1996, has accomplished a major transfer of resources and responsibility from the federal government back to the states — with an accompanying improvement in the program itself."	301	"3"
"Applying that approach to other programs will steer Congress back into line with the Constitution, reversing both its intrusion into state matters and its neglect of its central duties."	203	"2"
"To aid in the fulfillment of those duties, we propose a National Sunset Commission to review all federal programs and recommend which of them should be terminated due to redundancy, waste, or intrusion into the American family."	303	"3"
"The Congress would then be required by law to schedule one yea or nay vote on the entire sunset list with no amendments."	303	"3"

"Congress Must Improve Oversight of Government Programs"	NA	NA

"To that end:  • We urge every congressional committee to reserve at least one week every month to conduct oversight of the nearly 1,700 separate grant and loan programs of the federal government."	303	"3"
"* To prevent conflicts of interest, a Truth in Testimony mandate should require all committee witnesses to detail the amount of federal funding they and their employer currently receive and, in the case of associations, how much federal money their members would receive from the proposed legislation."	303	"3"
"* Because official Washington does not even know how much land it owns, we call for a national audit of all federally-owned properties as a first step toward returning unnecessary properties to the American people or to state and local government for public use."	303	"3"
"Improving the Work of Government"	NA	NA
"Modern management of the federal government is long overdue."	303	"3"

"Each agency must be able to pass a financial audit and set annual targets for improving efficiency with fewer resources."	303	"3"

"We call it an unconscionable assault on the paychecks and pocketbooks of every hard-working American household."	305	"3"

"Our repeated warnings about the corruption at the heart of the trial bar have been vindicated by high-profile criminal convictions and prison terms for some of the nation's leading class action and personal injury trial lawyers."	605	"6"
"All plaintiffs, especially those who must hire personal injury lawyers on a contingency basis, should be protected against abuse by their attorneys, and the attorney-client privilege should be defended as a bulwark in the defense of liberty."	605	"6"
